## Overview
When taking long flights via airplane, the destination is often not reached directly; layovers occur. The efficiency of taking layovers compared to taking a direct flight is a question that can be solved via graph algorithms; particularly, we use Djikstra's algorithm to find the minimum path from one airport, $v_A$, to another airport, $v_B$. This is done by treating the collection of airports as a graph, where flights between airports are edges. These edges can be assigned weights corresponding to costs, such as time, monetary cost, and efficiency; using Djikstra's algorithm will allow us to find a path that minimizes these quantities. Additionally, we compare the practicality of other algorithms, such as BFS (Breadth-first search) and DFS (Depth-first search). All of our programmed algorithms are in Python.
